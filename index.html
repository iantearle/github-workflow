			<p>Hello! My name is <a href="http://twitter.com/_dte">Dan Eden</a>, and I recently updated <a href="http://daneden.me/2012/09/changing-my-ways/">my workflow</a> to include Git and GitHub. It&rsquo;s made my work more portable, my workflow <a href="http://www.openlogic.com/wazi/bid/188103/Stop-Using-FTP-How-to-Transfer-Files-Securely">more secure</a>, and helped me learn more about the command line interface, thus making me <a href="http://bukk.it/boss.gif">look awesome</a>.</p>
			<p>But what&rsquo;s the point in looking and acting smart if you can&rsquo;t help the rest of the world look and act smart too? There isn&rsquo;t one. So I made this short tutorial on how to get Git and Github integrated into your workflow.</p>

			<h2 class="gamma">Need-to-knows</h2>
			<p>This tutorial is going to assume a few things. Namely:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You have a <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a> account</li>
				<li>You know <a href="http://try.github.com/levels/1/challenges/1">the basics</a> of using Git</li>
				<li>You have SSH access to a Linux-based server with Git already installed</li>
				<li>You have a <a href="http://www.lukejones.me/articles/set-up-a-local-server-on-os-x/">local development environment</a> set up already</li>
				<li>You&rsquo;re using a Mac (Windows users, you&rsquo;re probably smart enough to follow along and translate for your platform) and have <a href="http://mac.github.com">GitHub for Mac</a> (or <a href="http://windows.github.com">Windows</a>) installed</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Got all that? Excellent. Let&rsquo;s get started. In the examples below, we&rsquo;ll be adjusting our FTP-based workflow on an existing site to integrate Git and GitHub.</p>

			<h2 class="step-title">Step 1</h2>
			<span class="subtitle">Setting up repositories</span>
			<p>First things first. We need repositories on our local environment, our GitHub account, and our remote website. The first two are easy.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>In GitHub, click the &ldquo;Create a new repo&rdquo; link. Give the repository a name (like example.com), a description, and choose whether to make it public or private. Private repos are definitely a good idea for client and personal work, but require a paid plan.</li>
				<li>On the next page, click &ldquo;Setup in Mac.&rdquo; GitHub for Mac will open, where you can choose a location for the repository (somewhere you can access it via your local server)</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Great - now you can make changes on your local copy and it&rsquo;ll sync up to GitHub. But we&rsquo;re still missing the clever part - getting those changes from GitHub to the remote server.</p>
			<p>So our next step is setting up the repository on the remote server. Let&rsquo;s do that now.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Open up a terminal and SSH into your remote server (<code>ssh example.com</code>)</li>
				<li>Navigate to the folder where you want the repository. In this example, the files are all in <code>example.com/html/</code>, so that's where we want our repo.</li>
				<li>Initialise a git repository with <code>git init</code></li>
				<li>Add the GitHub repo as a remote with <code>git remote add origin git@github.com:daneden/example.com.git</code></li>
				<li>This next step is a little more complicated. Long story short, you need to tell the local master branch to track the remote master branch. To do that, you should edit <code>.git/config</code> and add the following code to the bottom:
					<pre class="prettyprint">[branch "master"]
	remote = origin
	merge = refs/heads/master</pre></li>
				<li>Finally, add your files with <code>git add .</code>, commit with <code>git commit -am "Initial commit"</code> and push to GitHub with <code>git push origin master</code> (Note that in future, you'll only need to use <code>git push</code>)</li>
			</ol>
			<p>If you&rsquo;ve gotten this far, well done. After you sync your local repo in GitHub for Mac one more time, you&rsquo;ll have identical copies of your site on your local server, remote server, and on GitHub. Give yourself a <a href="http://bukk.it/high-five.gif">high five</a>.</p>

			<span class="subtitle">.gitignore, WebHooks, and other smart stuff</span>
			<p>I&rsquo;m willing to bet that the files you now have three instances of combine to form some sort of database-driven web application. And I&rsquo;m willing to bet you have a different database configuration on your local server than your remote. You want to tell Git to ignore your database configuration files so that you don&rsquo;t end up with local database settings on the web, and vice versa.</p>
			<p>Create a file called <code>.gitignore</code> inside your repository. In there, you can make a list of all the files you want Git to ignore. For instance, in WordPress you&rsquo;ll want to ignore <code>wp-config.php</code>, so the contents of your <code>.gitignore</code> file might simply be:</p>
			<pre class="prettyprint">wp-config.php</pre>
			<p>You can ignore files with a particular extension, and recognize files in previously ignored locations:</p>
			<pre class="prettyprint"># Ignore these files and folders
wp-config.php
wp-content/uploads/*

# Ignore data and junk files
*.DS_Store
*Thumbs.DB

# Recognise these files in previously ignored locations
!wp-content/uploads/.htaccess</pre>
			<p>Commit and sync the repo, and it&rsquo;ll go on up to GitHub too. But wait a second, we&rsquo;re <em>still</em> missing that final step - getting our code from GitHub to the remote server. Well, we need one more file for that.</p>

			<h3>The final touch</h3>
			<p>Create a PHP file - the name doesn&rsquo;t matter, just don&rsquo;t make it easy to guess - with the following contents:</p>
			<pre class="prettyprint">&lt;?php
	`git pull`;</pre>
			<p>Commit, sync, then SSH back into your server and run <code>git pull</code> inside your remote repository.</p>
			<p>Once you&rsquo;ve done that, go to the Admin section of your GitHub repository and click on &ldquo;Service Hooks.&rdquo; Click on &ldquo;WebHook URLs&rdquo; and enter the URL for the script you created a few minutes ago.</p>
			<p>Take a deep breath, then click &ldquo;Update Settings.&rdquo; Congratulations. You are awesome. From now on, any changes that you make to your Git repository - locally, remotely (with <code>git push</code>), or on GitHub.com will be pushed live to your site.</p>

			<span class="subtitle">Make this guide better</span>
			<p>With any luck, this short guide has helped you to get Git and Github integrated in your workflow. But it was written by a designer (yuck! Am I right, developers?) who&rsquo;s new to all this stuff. There are bound to be missing steps, typos, and downright stupidness in the information above.</p>
			<p>Luckily, this entire guide is on <a href="https://github.com/daneden/github-workflow/tree/gh-pages">GitHub</a>, meaning that you can fork it and improve it for yourself and other people.</p>
